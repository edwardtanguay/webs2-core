# webs2-core

## when creating an app

- make a directory of its name in the directory above this one, e.g. if name is "frenchnouns" make a directory "../frenchnouns"
- create the app with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- HTML file is called index.html
- There is one CSS file called main.css
- There is one JS file called main.js
- All files should be in the same directory

## characteristics of an app

- it is always responsive for mobile and desktop
- there is always a small link at the top of the app that says "(see more projects by Edward)" where "Edward" links to "https://tanguay.info" in a new tab
- always give it a light/dark switch

## quality check

- if you have e.g. items that have spaces like "1.99 €" that should stay together, make sure it doesn't break on the space
- if you have a checklist of checkboxes, that the boxes are top-aligned, not in the middle of the text

## add to tanguay.info site

- when you create a new app, also go to "../tinfo" and add an entry for that app
- if it is an app that has to do with learning languages, then add it under the sub-header "language sites"
	- otherwise add it under the sub-header "other projects"

## after creating or updating an app

- change the CSS link with a cache buster so it always reloads
- upload app via FTP (see ".env" file for FTP infos)
	- e.g. if app is "frenchnouns", then upload "../frenchnouns" to the webs2 server in "public_html/frenchnouns".
- after updating "../tinfo" then upload ONLY THE FOLLOWING:
	- '../tinfo/index.html' to "public_html/index.html"
	- '../tinfo/styles.css' to "public_html/styles.css"
